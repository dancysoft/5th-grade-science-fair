   The data collected in these files was not used for analysis because
   they were collected before making improvements to the stability of the
   measurement device connections.  They also tested 3 different brands

04-safeway.csv
   Another device was plugged into the host computer while this test
   was running and it clearly affected the readings so it was thrown
   out.  07-safeway.csv is the re-run.
